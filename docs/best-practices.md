- Monitor and optimize costs regularly

## Deployment Practices

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Use infrastructure validation in pipelines
- Implement automated testing
- Use staging environments for validation

### Environment Management
- Separate development, staging, and production
- Use parameter files for environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper change management processes

## Documentation

- Keep documentation up-to-date with infrastructure changes
